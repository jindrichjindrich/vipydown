## Installation

Right now, the vipydown.py script can be used only as a standalone [Python](https://python.org) file
which you download and place to any empty folder of your choice. Also, the Python
(version 3.6 or above) must be installed on your computer and must be available 
from command line (i.e., folder where the python.exe is located must be in the 
PATH environmental variable).

  1. Download the vipydown.py
  2. Move it to an empty folder of your choice to which you have a write access
     e.g. C:\Users\USER\vipydown
  3. Run the vipydown.py, either from cmd: "python vipydown.py" or by clinking
     the file by a mouse.
  4. The vipydown.py will create vipydown.lnk file and copy it to Desktop
  
  
## Usage

1. Start the vipydown server and web client by clicking the vipydown link on the Desktop
2. Wait few seconds for the server to update the youtube_dl module/script
3. Your default web browser will be pointed to the vipydown web page, where  
   you can copy/paste address(es) of the video(s) you want to download
4. Click the Download button. The download will start and the downloaded files  
   will be placed to default Download folder, eventually to its subfolder specified
   in the web interface.
